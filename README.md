# Python-Crop-Yield-Project
## Project Summary
As a crop yield analyst for an agriculture company, this project involves analyzing agricultural data to explore key factors affecting crop yield. The process begins with an exploratory visual analysis in Python, followed by hypothesis development to identify significant relationships between variables such as rainfall, temperature, and irrigation. Advanced analytical techniques are then applied to test these hypotheses. The findings are presented in an interactive Tableau dashboard that showcases the key insights discovered during the analysis. Additional analyses and results are stored in a GitHub repository for further exploration and documentation.
## Key Questions
1. Which variables have the strongest correlation with the crop yield?
2. Does the use of fertilizers improve yield for crops
3. Are yields significantly higher for crops that are irrigated vs non-irrigated crops?
4. Is there a certain region that produces more crop than others?
5. Does weather condition have an effect on crop yield?
## Folders
Description of folder contents are as follows:

Tableau was used for visual creation and presentation
## Disclaimer
This dataset is a combination of real and synthetic data. While synthetic data is used to enhance the dataset and fill in gaps, it is important to recognize that its inclusion may introduce several biases. Some of these biases could include
- Misrepresentation Bias: Synthetic data may not accurately reflect the true variability and characteristics of the real-world data, potentially distorting the overall distribution and relationships in the dataset.
- Distribution Bias: The synthetic data may not follow the same distribution as the real data, leading to artificial patterns that do not exist in reality. This could affect the generalizability of any conclusions drawn from the data.
- Confirmation Bias: The synthetic data may have been generated with certain assumptions or goals in mind, potentially reinforcing pre-existing hypotheses or expected trends, which could lead to biased or incorrect conclusions.
